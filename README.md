> A curated list of Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) libraries, tools and resources.

Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models.
See the [official FMI website](http://fmi-standard.org/) for the official specification and more information about the FMI standard.

## FMI 3

FMI 3.0  development is currently in Alpha phase. General information on the FMI 3.0 feature list can be found in https://fmi-standard.org/faq/, and the development is ongoing on the repo https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard . You can find the latest, automatically generated version of the FMI 3.0 alpha standard at https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0-dev/ .

**Warning: FMI 3.0 is still under heavy development, and most of the tools listed in the following they support it only in an experimental way. If you want stable tools, use FMI 2 for the time being.**

Some of the projects listed in the previous section also have prototypal support for FMI 3 alpha: 

- **Examples**: 
  - [Reference-FMUs](https://github.com/modelica/Reference-FMUs) : `3.0-alpha.5` examples FMUs are available, including examples for new co-simulation features such as scheduled co-simulation and early return in co-simulation.
  - [PMSFIT/FMI30TestFMUs](https://github.com/PMSFIT/FMI30TestFMUs) : Some examples FMUs based on the draft FMI 3.0 specificatiion are available, including features such as binary variables.
- **Python:** 
  - [fmpy](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy) - As of verson `0.2.26` experimental support for FMI `3.0-alpha.5` is available.
- **Simulink:** 
  - [FMIKit-Simulink](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMIKit-Simulink) - As of version `2.9` experimental support for export of FMU `3.0-alpha.5` is available.
- **Formal models**
  - [FMI-VDM-Model](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/FMI-VDM-Model) - [VDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Development_Method) formal models for the FMI3.0 specification.
